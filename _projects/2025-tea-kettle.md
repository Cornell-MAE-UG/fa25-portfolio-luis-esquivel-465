This project investigates the thermodynamic performance of an electric tea kettle by quantifying heat transfer, electrical work input, losses to the environment, and the transient temperature rise of water during heating.

The full multi-page report (with equations, plots, and analysis) is available here:

## Project Overview

- Modeled heating as a transient lumped-capacitance energy balance  
- Calculated theoretical vs actual efficiency  
- Determined the effective thermal resistance and heat loss  
- Compared electrical work input to enthalpy rise of water  
- Evaluated steady-state vs transient behavior  
- Conducted experimental validation with temperature vs time data
